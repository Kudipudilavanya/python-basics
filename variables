Python is a cross-platform programming language, which means that it can run on multiple platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, and has even been ported to the Java and .
NET virtual machines. It is free and open-source.

Alright, let's dive into Python variables! In Python, variables are used to store and manage data. You can think of them as containers that hold information.

To create a variable, you simply choose a name and assign a value to it. For example:

python

age = 25
name = "John"
height = 5.9
In this example, age, name, and height are variable names, and 25, "John", and 5.9 are the values assigned to these variables.

Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't have to explicitly declare the type of a variable. The interpreter determines the type based on the value assigned.

You can also reassign variables with new values:

python

age = 25
print(age)  # Output: 25

age = 30
print(age)  # Output: 30
Python variables make it easy to work with different types of data in your programs. If you have any specific questions or if there's something specific you'd like to know about Python variables, feel free to ask!
